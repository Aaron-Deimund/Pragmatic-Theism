    <h1>Pragmatic-Theism</h1>
    <p>A convenient and sufficiently nerdy place to collect my thoughts, assumptions, and beliefs.</p>

    <h2>Some Disclaimers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>While I will use the Bible and potentially other sacred texts, I don't here feel constrained to conform to
            what may be appropriate exegesis in other settings. I will not be justifying or arguing with anyone but
            myself.
        </li>
        <li>Some of my current beliefs may contradict one another. My brain right now is a brackish soup of all the
            ideas and assumptions I've accumulated over the years, some examined and some unexamined. I'm Okay with
            that.
        </li>
        <li>I'm not going to define words that are commonly misunderstood, but words that are potentially ambiguous. For
            example, I will not define theory if I talk about a scientific theory, even though it's often mistakenly
            taken to mean someone's hunch or unjustified guess.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Terms</h2>
    <dt>Evidence</dt>
    <dd>Observable repeatable physical falsifiable support for a claim.</dd>
    <dt>Proof</dt>
    <dd>A mathematical tautology.</dd>
    <p>In my everyday life I'm fine with the conflation of evidence and proof as in most contexts they are synonymous,
        but here I will make a concerted effort to keep the two separate.
    </p>

    <dt>Faith</dt>
    <dd>The affirmation of something hoped for or a belief in something empirically unfalsifiable.</dd>
    <p>For me, it's easiest to start with the Bible and adapt from Hebrews 11:1. Even here there are significant
        differences in translations.
    </p>

    <dt>God</dt>
    <dd>The creator and sustainer of our current existence.</dd>
    <p>I won't make any claims about God's attributes here, but I will avoid using the traditional Christian
        designations
        of He and Father unless I am talking specifically about the Trinity.
    </p>

    <h2>Things That Happened</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The sudden expansion of time-space some 14 billion years ago.</li>
        <li>The formation of Earth around 4.5 billion years ago.</li>
        <li>Single cell life formed around 3.75 billion years ago. I'm open to a natural explanation for this event, but
            this is
            currently unexplained.
        </li>
        <li>Evolution by natural selection. Humans are no exception and first appeared around 2 million years ago.</li>
        <li>4,000 God</li>
    </ul>
