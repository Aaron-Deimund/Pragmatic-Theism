<body>
    <h1>Pragmatic-Theism</h1>
    <p>A convenient and sufficiently nerdy place to collect my thoughts, assumptions, and beliefs. I may change the name
        later.</p>

    <h2>Some Disclaimers</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>I can be a bit pompas, pretentious or irreverent here. Honestly, if that bothers you this may not be reading
            that will interest you.</li>
        <li>My knowledge of theology, philosophy, logic, and science is incomplete at best and outright wrong at worst.
            Don't believe anything I say.</li>
        <li>While I will use the Bible and potentially other sacred texts, I don't here feel constrained to conform to
            what may be appropriate exegesis in other settings. I will not be justifying anything to or arguing with
            anyone but myself.</li>
        <li>Some of my current beliefs may contradict one another. My brain right now is a brackish soup of all the
            ideas and assumptions I've accumulated over the years, some examined and some unexamined. I'm Okay with
            that.</li>
        <li>I'm not going to define words that are commonly misunderstood, but only words that are potentially
            ambiguous. For example, I will not define theory if I talk about a scientific theory, even though it's often
            mistakenly taken to mean someone's hunch or unjustified guess.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Terms</h2>

    <dt>Miracles</dt>
    <dd>Extremely rare exceptions to the natural order of things, not an acceptable explanation for gaps in
        understanding.</dd>
    <br>

    <dt>Evidence</dt>
    <dd>Observable repeatable physical falsifiable support for a claim.</dd>
    <br>

    <dt>Proof</dt>
    <dd>A mathematical tautology.</dd>
    <p>In my everyday life I'm fine with the conflation of evidence and proof as in most contexts they are synonymous,
        but here I will make a concerted effort to keep the two separate.
    </p>
    <br>

    <dt>Faith</dt>
    <dd>The affirmation of something hoped for or a belief in something empirically unfalsifiable.</dd>
    <p>For me, it's easiest to start with the Bible and adapt from Hebrews 11:1. Even here there are significant
        differences in translations.
    </p>
    <br>

    <dt>God</dt>
    <dd>The creator and sustainer of our current existence.</dd>
    <p>I won't make any claims about God's attributes here, but I will avoid using the traditional Christian
        designations of He and Father unless I am talking specifically about the Trinity.
    </p>
    <br>

    <dt>YHWH</dt>
    <dd>The Judaeo-Christian God of the Bible.</dd>
    <br>

    <dt>Holy Spirit</dt>
    <dd>An aspect of YWHW assumed when interacting with individuals.</dd>
    <br>

    <dt>Jesus Christ</dt>
    <dd>An aspect of YHWH assumed when taking human form.</dd>
    <br>

    <dt>The Father</dt>
    <dd>An aspect of YHWH assumed when receiving prayers from supplicants</dd>
    <br>


    <h2>Assumptions And Axioms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>God Exists.</li>
        <li>Physics works the same now as it always has, or Uniformitarianism.</li>
        <li>There is a natural explanation for everything, or Naturalism.</li>
        <li>Miracles are an exceptionally rare departure from the last rule, and are real.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Things That Happened</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The sudden expansion of time-space some 14 billion years ago.</li>
        <li>The formation of Earth around 4.5 billion years ago.</li>
        <li>Single cell life formed around 3.75 billion years ago. I'm open to a natural explanation for this event, but
            this is currently unexplained.
        </li>
        <li>Evolution by natural selection. Humans are no exception and first appeared around 2 million years ago.</li>
        <li>At some point God made itself known to Israelites as YHWH and established an agreement with Abraham that
            became known as the Covenant.</li>
        <li>Through the Holy Spirit</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Things That Didn't Happen</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 day creation event.</li>
        <li>A global flood.</li>
        <li>The zombie outbreak described in Matthew 27:52-53</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Things You Shouldn't Say To Me</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I wasn't there, so I'll just have to take God's word for it.</li>
        <li>How else do you explain...</li>
        <li>You can't disprove...</li>
        <li>'Just' a scientific theory.</li>
        <li>You are just not mature enough in your faith.</li>
        <li>Read this book explaining a position I am either too lazy to articulate or don't really understand myself,
            and get back to me. This is hyperbole, but reflects what I hear.</li>
    </ul>
