# Pragmatic-Theism
A convenient and sufficiently nerdy place to collect my thoughts, assumptions, and beliefs.

## Some Disclaimers
- While I will use the Bible and potentially other sacred texts, I don't here feel constrained to conform to what may be appropriate exegesis in other settings. I will not be justifying or arguing with anyone but myself.

## Seems like a good idea to define some terms, especially the squishy ones.

### Faith
-The affirmation of something hoped for or a belif in something emperically unobservable.

For me, it's easiest to start with the Bible and adapt from Hebrews 11:1. Even here there are signifigant differences in translations.

## Things That Happened
-The sudden expansion of time-space some 14 billion years ago.
-The formation of Earth around 4.5 billion years ago.
-Single cell life formed around 3.75 billion years ago. I'm open to a natural explanation for this event, but this is currently unexplained.
-Evolution by natural selection. Humans are no exception and begain appearing around 2 million years ago.
