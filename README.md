# Pragmatic-Theism
A convenient and sufficiently nerdy place to collect my thoughts, assumptions, and beliefs. I'll use this file as a staging area for content.

## Some Disclaimers
- While I will use the Bible and potentially other sacred texts, I don't here feel constrained to conform to what may be appropriate exegesis in other settings. I will not be justifying or arguing with anyone but myself.
- Some of my current beliefs may contradict one another. My brain right now is a brackish soup of all the ideas and assumptions I've accumulated over the years, some examined and some unexamined. I'm Okay with that.
- I'm not going to define words that are commonly misunderstood, but words that are potentially ambiguous. For example, I will not define theory if I talk about a scientific theory, even though it's often mistakenly taken to mean someone's hunch or unjustified guess.

## Terms

### Evidence
- Observable repeatable physical falsifiable support for a claim.

### Proof
- A mathematical tautology.

In my everyday life I'm fine with the conflation of evidence and proof as in most contexts they are synonymous, but here I will make a concerted effort to keep the two separate.

### Faith
- The affirmation of something hoped for or a belief in something empirically unfalsifiable.

For me, it's easiest to start with the Bible and adapt from Hebrews 11:1. Even here there are significant differences in translations.

### God
- The creator and sustainer of our current existence.

I won't make any claims about God's attributes here, but I will avoid using the traditional Christian designations of He and Father unless I am talking specifically about the Trinity.

## Things That Happened
- The sudden expansion of time-space some 14 billion years ago.
- The formation of Earth around 4.5 billion years ago.
- Single cell life formed around 3.75 billion years ago. I'm open to a natural explanation for this event, but this is currently unexplained.
- Evolution by natural selection. Humans are no exception and first appeared around 2 million years ago.
- 4,000 the God
